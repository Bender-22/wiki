## Instruction Language

The age group we are targeting is primary school age (6-11). These children are old enough to speak and understand their mother tongue well, and we believe that it's important to use a child's [mother tongue as the language of instruction](https://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/children-learn-better-their-mother-tongue) to achieve the most efficient learning.

## Personalized Learning ðŸš€

For _personalized learning_ to be truly effective, each child should have their own Android device. The software is designed to automatically adapt the educational content and apps to the current knowledge level of the child, so if another child uses the same user account on the same Android device, the personalized learning will not work.

At the very least, a separate Android user should be created for each child if they have to share the same device. For more information on how Android user management works, see [Supporting Multiple Users | Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/multi-user).
