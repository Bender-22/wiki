## Instruction Language

The age group we are targeting is primary school age (6-11). These children are old enough to speak and understand their mother tongue well, and we believe that it's important to use a child's [mother tongue as the language of instruction](https://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/children-learn-better-their-mother-tongue) to achieve the most efficient learning.
