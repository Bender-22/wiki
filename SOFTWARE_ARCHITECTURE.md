## Learning Platform

The [elimu.ai](http://elimu.ai) software is a _platform_ of educational content and Android apps.

Instead of having one large Android application containing everything, the [elimu.ai](http://elimu.ai) software has been architected such that there are many smaller applications, each with their own specific responsibility.

Broadly speaking, there are three categories of Android applications:
  1. Infrastructural applications
  2. Literacy apps/games
  3. Numeracy apps/games
