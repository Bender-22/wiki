### Purpose

The purpose of the elimu.ai Community is to provide out-of-school children with access to quality basic education.

### Why? üåç

Currently, around [64 million](http://uis.unesco.org/en/news/new-education-data-sdg-4-and-more) children across the globe do not have access to quality basic education. We believe that a quality basic education is the right of _every child_, no matter her social or geographical background.

The number of children who are excluded from education fell steadily in the decade following 2000, but [UNESCO statistics](http://uis.unesco.org/en/news/new-education-data-sdg-4-and-more) show that this progress essentially stopped in recent years:

### How Can We Solve the Problem? üí°

Our solution is to develop software for teaching out-of-school children the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic. A collection of [educational apps](http://elimu.ai) teaches children basic literacy and numeracy in a fun and engaging way. This empowers each child to learn fully autonomously, without depending on the availability of qualified teachers.
